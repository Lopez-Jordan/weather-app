# weather-app

## Description
    This my first project where I used and implemented server side api's!
    In this simple 5 day forecast weather app, the user can submit a city name
    and a 5 day forecast will be dynamically generated using openweathermap's api (linked below).
    
## Technologies
    HTML/CSS/JavaScript/jQuery
    Open Weather's api:

## Credits
